METHODS 
Participants and Procedures 
Ethical approval was granted through the University of Galway School of Psychology research 
ethics committee. A cross-sectional online survey was employed. Recruitment occurred via 
social media, neurology clinics, and promotion by Chronic Pain Ireland and the Migraine 
Association. Adults aged 18 years and above who were treated for stroke or traumatic brain 
injury (TBI) and have been experiencing chronic headaches, including migraines, were 
included. Participants completed the survey on the Qualtrics platform and were presented with 
an information sheet and consent form before participation. 
Measures 
Demographic Questionnaire: A 21-item demographic questionnaire was developed covering 
demographic variables such as age, sex, occupation, working hours per week, and health-
related information such as diagnosis of stroke and TBI, onset of headaches, frequency and 
duration, lifestyle, and sleep. 
Headache Characteristics: Information was obtained through a customized set of questions 
designed to assess the frequency, type, severity, and triggers of headaches. Questions included: 
"How many days per month, on average, do you have a headache?", "Do you currently 
experience migraine headaches?", and "What tends to trigger or aggravate your headaches 
now?". 

Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS): The PCS, which includes thirteen items scored on a 5-
point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time), was used to measure the degree to which 
individuals catastrophize during pain episodes. The PCS assesses rumination, magnification, 
and helplessness. It is a reliable measure with high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 
0.87) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.75). 
Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21): The DASS-21, a 21-item self-report 
instrument, assesses depression, anxiety, and stress, with each item scored on a 4-point Likert 
scale from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much or most of the time). It 
has high internal consistency: depression (Cronbach's alpha = 0.88), anxiety (0.82), and stress 
(0.90). 
Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS): Participants rated their current pain intensity using the 
NPRS, indicating their pain on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). 
Data Analysis 
Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 27. Data were screened 
for outliers and incomplete responses, and any identified outliers were assessed for their impact 
on the overall dataset. Descriptive statistics summarized the characteristics of the study sample, 
including demographic variables and the intensity of chronic headaches. 
To address the research questions, the following analyses were conducted: 
1. Bivariate Correlations: Bivariate correlations were performed to examine the 
relationships between headache characteristics (e.g., frequency, intensity) and 
psychological symptoms measured by the DASS-21. This analysis helped identify 
significant associations and potential interaction effects between these variables. 
2. Hierarchical Logistic Regression: Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were 
conducted to identify predictors of chronic headache severity. Variables entered into 
the regression models included demographic factors (age, sex), injury-related factors 
(type of injury, severity), and psychological variables (PCS scores, DASS-21 scores). 
This analysis determined the unique contributions of each predictor variable to 
headache severity and its impact on daily functioning and psychological health. 

3. Independent Samples t-tests and ANOVA: Independent samples t-tests and ANOVA 
were used to compare levels of psychological distress (DASS-21 scores) between 
groups based on headache type and injury type. Post-hoc tests were conducted to 
explore significant differences further. 
These analyses were chosen based on their ability to address the specific research questions 
and hypotheses, providing a comprehensive understanding of the relationships and predictors 
involved in chronic headaches and psychological distress in stroke and TBI populations.
